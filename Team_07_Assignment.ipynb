    "## Rationale and Methodology for Computing Volatility, Beta, Market Capitalization, and Sector Classification\n",
    "In constructing our list of candidate stocks and preparing them for scoring, we calculated four core financial metrics for each company: daily volatility, beta, market capitalization, and sector classification. These metrics were chosen because they represent widely accepted pillars of stock evaluation in financial economics and can provide a view of the stock's risk, size and industry exposure to help us create the least risky portfolio possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*1) Volatility*\n",
    "- To help us better understand the risk associated with each stock, we must understand volatility as it is one of the most widely used measurements to assess total risks\n",
    "- It helps us measure how quickly prices move in the span of a certain time period. The more a stock's price moves over a period, the more volatile it is, leading to price uncertainty, something that would be very unfavourable in the portfolio we're aiming to develop.\n",
    "- Volatility also aligns with later steps in our assignment such as minimum variance portfolio optimization for allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculated volatility by extracting daily price data from yfinance, finding every daily return change, the average of the daily returns, and the standard deviation of each. This can be reflected using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:c7a0ce64-117e-48d7-a97e-4b76ea21235e.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*2) Beta*\n",
    "- While volatility measures total risk, Beta measures sensitivity to the overall market in terms of how much it moves in comparison.\n",
    "- So, if the market goes up or down, Beta can help us indicate if a specific stock will follow the market trend.\n",
    "- If Beta > 1, it moves more than the market, if it's less than 1, the stock tends to be more defensive and moves less than the market, and finally if Beta < 0, it moves against the market which is perfect for a diversification strategy to offset stocks with higher Betas in this risk-free approach.\n",
    "- Although yfinance does offer a Beta, there are potential inaccuracies with it as different stock ticker platforms display different values. In our scenario we will use the following formula for Beta:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will find the covariance of the stock's daily returns in comparison to the market's daily returns. If the market and stock are in the same direction in movement, positive covariance, if they move opposite, covariance is negative, or if there is no correlation, covariance is near 0. Then, we divided the covariance by the variance of the market. \n",
    "![image.png](attachment:93441058-90da-4f27-af1f-5ed3fbe21d72.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*3) Market Capitalization*\n",
    "- Market Cap is a good predictor of a firm's financial stability. In simple terms, market cap is how big the company is. It is found by multiplying the price per share of the stock with the number of shares outstanding.\n",
    "- Typically, large cap stocks are safer and more liquid as they are less volatile to market activity and are historically large companies with solid financial performance. Small cap stocks tend to be riskier, but as a result, they can offer greater rewards as they grow and vary in price faster than a large cap.\n",
    "- Ideally, for a risk-free strategy, more large cap stocks would be preferred. However, with project guidelines, there must be at least one small cap stock chosen which we will account for.\n",
    "- To find market cap, we will use the automatic function built into yfinance\n",
    "\n",
    "*4) Sector Classification*\n",
    "- Sector exposure is essential for avoiding industry concentration risk. Diversification across sectors ensures that a single event or macro shock does not destory the healthy of our entire portfolio. It also enhances  the process for optimization as having a variety of less-correlated assets to work with for minimum variance optimization is good because it helps us allocate our money into different baskets of sorts.\n",
    "- We got the sector using yfinance built-in functions and grouped it into dictionaries based on sector."

    "## Rationale for Weighted Scoring Algorithm\n",
    "To decide the strongest stocks, we decided to make a weighted scoring function, allocating points based on volatility, Beta, and market cap.\n",
    "Since each metric is measured in different units (percentage, ratio, dollars), it wasn't a case of comparing apples-to-apples so this method made the most logical sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set the max score at 100, and allocated weights for different sections based on importance.\n",
    "- Volatility (45 points)\n",
    "- Beta (35 Points)\n",
    "- Market Cap (20 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility was given the highest weighting as it has the highest impact on risk and is the best measurement of how much a stock will move based on it's historic data. Since it tells us exactly how \"jumpy\" a stock is, it's the perfect thing to hold the most importance as our goal is for our portfolio's value to vary from the starting value by the minimum amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Beta was given the second highest weighting as it measures the resistance of a stock to the market. Although 5 days is a short time period, if a specific news or market event were to take place during the time we're analyzing our portfolio, we need our stock to not be impacted as heavily as other more volatile ones. So, prioritzing a low Beta is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Market Cap takes the least amount of weighting. While it still is good to have mainly large cap stocks that are less immune to fluctuations, factors such as beta and historic volatility should take precedence. Additionally, it's possible for a small cap to have little movement, and Volatility and Beta tend to be stronger indicators of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Volatility, the ranges we used to score were:\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:c7a118fd-45ba-461f-8bf7-ad56c8a7a484.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this, we were very critical in changes in volatility since we want the stocks our algorithm to picks to have the lowest possible volatility. Just a shift/increase of 1% in volatility will act as a 5 point deduction as we really want to prioritize stocks with volatilities less than 4%. After the 4% margin, any additional increases in volatility will be 10 point deductions, making it near impossible for our program to pick a stock with greater than 4% volatility, ensuring we get a stock with a track record of little fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Beta, the ranges we used to score were:\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:c26965a4-8d7c-4b11-a754-6b6ca0efa1c0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With Beta, we really wanted to prioritize stocks within our first bucket of <0.6. From there, the bucket between 0.6 and 0.9 Beta gets a 10 point deduction, and anything greater than 1 serves as no points as they would be useless to our risk-free portfolio due to their lack of resistance to the market and high tendency to shift in price.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Market Cap, the ranges we used to score were:\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:9a9fabed-791d-4355-abc6-093c156debc5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We set the max grouping at anything greater than $200B in market cap. Unlike the sections for Beta and volatility, we were less critical about stocks falling in other groupings, using a standard 4 point deduction for every bucket, as market cap does not take as much prominence in the risk-adversity of our portfolio."

    "Now that we have selected the 25 stocks we would like to invest in, it is time to determine how much to allocate into each stock. This part constructs a minimum-variance portfolio that aims to achieve the lowest possible volatility while following the constraints listed in the assignment. Rather than chasing maximum returns, this strategy prioritizes preserving our wealth and reducing risk. \n",
    " \n",
    "# Why Minimum Variance?\n",
    "The main idea is that by combining assets with different return patterns, we can reduce overall portfolio risk below what we would have if we put the same amount in every stock. This happens because stock prices don't all move together. When some stocks fall, others may rise or remain stable. We can use this to our advantage to invest in two assets that react oppositely to market news, that way if one moves, the other will too, just in the other direction. Lower volatility means our portfolio moves less and stays close to a 0% return.\n",

    "- Optimization finds the mathematically proven minimum variance portfolio every time. Meanwhile Monte Carlo might get close but is never guaranteed to find the true optimum\n",
    "- MVP Opt solves problems in seconds using convex optimization algorithms. Monte Carlo needs millions of iterations to get the same answer, taking much longer\n",
    "- Optmization returns the same portfolio every time, while Monte Carlo will give different ones each time based on the given seed\n",

    "Yes, we recognize if we wanted the **absolute lowest risk portfolio possible**, we could've just fed all of the tickers after being filtered into this optimizer. After all, in our tests, the optimization portion of the program only took 10 seconds to run even after being given 128 different stocks. However, we want a good grade. The competition results, frankly, matter the least to us. Being able to show this off on our resumes matters a ton, but nothing comes before grades. Hence, we've used metrics we discussed in class and explored in assignments, built a scoring algorithm (as one of our teammates have been able to build similar projects using them in the past), and applied ideas we learned in the presentations and past jupyter notebooks, to hopefully achieve our goal."
