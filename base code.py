#WHAT WE MUST DO
# for each subpart of our to do list, write a 3-5 bullet-point explanation of why we are doing specific things
# basing it on real financial data and sources
# map each ticker to the sector that they are from in a dictionary
# make sure last is a small cap, its okay if multiple fit this description but last one MUST be small cap
# maybe find other ways to pick stocks if necessary
# max wants 25 stocks
