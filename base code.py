# Get/calculate volatility (std), beta, market cap, and sectors

# Use the weighted scoring algorithm in the doc to provide a score /100 per stock

# After scoring, put all stocks in lists based on sector

# Take the top 5 from each sector (based on their score /100) and put them in a new dataframe

# Then return the top 25

# Use minimum variance portfolio optimization to determine optimal weights per stock

# Calculate the shares per stock based on weightings and transaction costs

# Determine what will actually be the transaction cost (What is lower)
# Subtract that from the amount allocated to the company, and determine new total shares

# Verify that we meet all the constraints (one small cap, no more than 40% in one sector, etc.)

# Load final portfolio
